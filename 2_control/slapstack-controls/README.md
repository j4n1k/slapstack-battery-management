# SLAPStack-Controls
This package contains several control heuristics for the SLAPStack block 
stacking warehouse simulations. The code is hosted together with the simulation
on [github](https://github.com/malerinc/slapstack).

The following storage allocation problem (SLAP) policies are implemented:
* Closest Open Pure Lane (COPL)
* Class Based Popularity with the following stock keeping unit (SKU) popularity 
measures:
    * SKU Turnover time (indirectly proportional to popularity)
    * The historic number of picks per SKU (directly proportional to popularity)
    * The number of future SKU picks over the next planning period, e.g. week 
    (directly proportional to popularity)
    * The historic SKU throughput calculated as the sum of picks and deliveries 
    per SKU (directly proportional to popularity)
    * The future SKU throughput over the next planning period

The following unit load selection problem (ULSP) policies are implemented:
* Batch Last In First Out (BLIFO)
